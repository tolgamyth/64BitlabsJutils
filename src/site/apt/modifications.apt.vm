Modifying, Compiling, and Building the com.Ostermiller.util Java utilities

  The com.Ostermiller.util package is open source you can download the
  source code, make modifications, and distribute your changes in accordance
  with the {{{./license.html}license}}.  To get started, choose the "latest
  source code" from the {{{./download.html}downloads}}.  Extract the package

  There are several build dependencies such as {{{http://jflex.de/}JFlex}},
  however, Maven will take care of them for you and download all needed
  libraries and software.  Upon a successful build, you should find several
  .jar, .zip, .gz, and .bz2 files built in the target directory.
