Base64 Java Library

    * {{{./src/Base64.java.html}Base64.java Source Code}}

    * {{{./javadoc/Base64.html}Base64 Javadoc}}

  Base64 encoding and decoding of data from Java.  Encode and decode methods
  for Strings, byte arrays, and streams.

  Base64 is needed in many places other than its original use as an encoding
  format for transferring attachments in email.  It can be used anytime binary
  or arbitrary data needs to be represented in common printable characters.
  For example to connect to a web page that requires a username and password
  (basic authentication) you need to Base64 encode the username and password.

*Example

  Use base64 to add a basic authentication to an HTTP request

%{code-snippet|brush=java|file=src/site/snippet/Base64BasicAuthentication.java.snippet}

*Base64 is not Encryption

  Be aware that Base64 encoding in <not> encryption.  Base64 scrambles the
  output and it may appear to be unreadable, but it is easily deciphered by
  anybody with a little experience or time.  Base64 encoded strings will often end
  in one or two equal signs, and they will have only letters, numbers, pluses, and slashes.
  Once somebody figures out that it is in Base64, it is just a matter of running
  the decode method on it.  Furthermore, real encryption algorithms will change
  the entire output if one bit in the input changes.  If you change a letter in a
  your message and then re-encode it with Base64, only a few characters will
  change.  Base64 is not a substitute for encryption.  Base64 used this way is
  obfuscation, and rather poor obfuscation at that.  It may be a disservice to your
  users to use Base64 as obfuscation because it gives them the impression that
  their data is encrypted when it really isn't.

*Command Line Program

  To run Base64 as a stand alone program use the following command line:

----------------------------------------
java -classpath utils.jar Base64 <files>
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
Base64 [-eldagxfqQvV] <files>
Encode or decode using the base64 format.
  If no files are specified standard input and output will be used.
  --help            Print this help message.
  --version         Print out the version number.
  --about           Print out license and contact info.
  -g --guess        Guess from contents whether to decode or encode. (default)
  -e --encode       Apply base64 encoding.
  -l --lines        Insert line breaks when encoding. (default)
  --nolines         Insert no line breaks when encoding.
  -d --decode       Remove base64 encoding.
  -a --decodeall    When decoding, attempt badly formatted files.
  --decodegood      Don't decode badly formatted files.  (default)
  -x --ext <ext>    File extension to use. (default: base64)
  -f --force        Overwrite files without prompting
  --noforce         Don't overwrite files.  (default)
  -v --verbose      Print a message for each file encoded or decoded. (default)
  -q --quiet        Print error messages.
  -Q --reallyquiet  Print nothing.
