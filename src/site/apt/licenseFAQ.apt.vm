com.Ostermiller.util License FAQ

*Under what license are these utilities available?

  The 64bitlabsutils library is free software; you can redistribute it
  and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
  published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
  License or (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
  or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
  {{{./license.html}GNU General Public License}} for
  more details.

*Why is the GPL used?

  Stephen chose to license the com.Ostermiller.util Java utilities under the
  GNU General Public License. The GPL encourages open source development by
  requiring that derivatives remain open source. Anybody who distributes code
  based on these utilities must license that code under the GPL.

*Could it be licensed under something less restrictive?

  Many people request they receive a copy of the utilities licensed under the
  Library General Public License (LGPL) or a BSD style license.  The answer is
  firmly "no".  Those Licenses do not ensure that derivative works remain
  liberated.  If such a license were given, the libraries could then be used
  in closed source applications.

*How about a special one-time license just for this awesome project?

  The com.Ostermiller.util utilities have many contributing authors.
  Requesting the permission of all those authors is not possible since they
  do not all believe that one-time licenses should be awarded no matter how
  deserving the project.
