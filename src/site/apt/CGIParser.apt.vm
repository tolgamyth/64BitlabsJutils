CGI Query String Parser

    * {{{./src/CGIParser.java.html}CGIParser.java Source Code}}

    * {{{./javadoc/CGIParser.html}CGIParser Javadoc}}

  Parses ampersand and equal sign delimited data from the query string of URLs.

*CGIParser Usage in Servlets

  If using this class in servlets, you would request the parameters from the params
  object rather than from the request.

  Some servlet implementations do not parse the CGI name value pairs correctly for
  either POST or GET requests when there is a large amount of query data.  Luckily,
  you can parse the query data yourself.  I have written a class to do so.  Its methods
  for retrieving the name value pairs are identical to the three methods in the http
  request of the servlet.  The class can be created from the string of the GET request
  or the stream of the POST request.

*Example

  Use the CGI parser to power the get and post methods of a servlet:
