    * {{{./src/StraightStreamReader.java.html}StraightStreamReader.java Source Code}}

    * {{{./javadoc/StraightStreamReader.html}StraightStreamReader Javadoc}}

  An input stream reader that does not do character class translation.  You

  support Reader and not InputStreams.  One such example is the lexical
  analyzer JFlex.  There is some

  in its manual about how a class like this might come in handy.  This class
  is included with the binary scanning example that comes with JFlex.
