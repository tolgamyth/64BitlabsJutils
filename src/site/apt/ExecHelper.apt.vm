Helper Methods for Runtime.exec

    * {{{./src/ExecHelper.java.html}ExecHelper.java Source Code}}

  Utilities to make executing other programs from Java easier.

  The Runtime.exec method is particularly difficult to use to call external
  applications to do data processing compared to such functionality in other
  languages.  For example in Perl and bash, the target can be placed in back
  ticks and the standard output is placed directly into a variable. To
  achieve this functionality in Java, one would need to use Runtime.exec, get
  the process, read from both the output and the error streams, and buffer
  the data into a String yourself.  Or this library can be used.

  This class contains convenience methods to call Runtime.exec with a given
  command.  The methods block until the process exits and all the data
  returned by the command is buffered and returned to the application in a
  ExecHelper object.  The object has three fields: standard output, standard
  input, and the exit status.
